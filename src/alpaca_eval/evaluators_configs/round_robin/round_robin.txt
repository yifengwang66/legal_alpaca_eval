I want you to create a leaderboard of different of large-language models. To do so, I will give you the instructions (prompts) given to the models, and the responses of several models, and the reference answer of the instruction. Please rank these models based on the given reference answer to determine which responses are closest to the intended meaning and requirements of the reference answer. All inputs and outputs should be python dictionaries.

Here is the prompt and reference answer:
{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
    "reference_answer": """{reference_output}"""
}

Here are the outputs of the models:
[
    {
        "model": "model_1",
        "answer": """{output_1}"""
    },
    {
        "model": "model_2",
        "answer": """{output_2}"""
    }
]

Now please rank the models by the quality of their answers, so that the model with rank 1 has the best output. Then return a list of the model names and ranks, i.e., produce the following output:
[
    {'model': <model-name>, 'rank': <model-rank>},
    {'model': <model-name>, 'rank': <model-rank>}
]

Your response must be a valid Python list and should contain nothing else because we will directly execute it in Python. Please provide the ranking that the majority of humans would give.
